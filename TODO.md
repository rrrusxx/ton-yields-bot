## 🔥 Immediate (This Week)

- [ ] **NEW Badge Feature** 🆕
  - [ ] Add emoji indicator for new yield opportunities
  - [ ] Requires historical data tracking/comparison
  - [ ] Show which pools are newly added since last post
  - Priority: MEDIUM (you mentioned wanting to work on this)
- [ ] Start fetching TON wallet yields:
  - [ ] Telegram Wallet (@wallet) - custodial and self-custodial
  - [ ] MyTonWallet (MTW)
  - [ ] Tonkeeper
  - Priority: MEDIUM (this week if time permits)

## 🎯 Next Sprint (Current)

- [ ] **Tradoor Protocol Integration**
  - [ ] Research: What is Tradoor? (DeFi protocol on TON)
  - [ ] Identify data sources (DefiLlama, API, contracts)
  - [ ] Determine yield types and integration approach
  - [ ] Priority: Medium (needs research first)
- [ ] Research additional yield sources

## 📅 Next Week

- [ ] Add ETH and TAC asset clusters
- [ ] Expand asset classification beyond TON/STABLE/BTC

## 💭 Ideas to Explore

- [ ] **Points Tracking Feature** ⭐
  - [ ] Add emoji indicator for protocols that generate points (airdrops)
  - [ ] Challenge: Most protocols don't expose points data via API
  - [ ] Options:
    - Manual configuration (hardcode known points programs)
    - Scraping (not ideal, fragile)
    - Wait for protocols to add points APIs
  - [ ] Priority: Low (technically difficult, data availability issue)
- [ ] Web dashboard with Fresh
- [ ] User alerts system (APY changes, new opportunities)
- [ ] Wallet integration (track user positions)
